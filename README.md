Package jwt provides a middleware for the [Goa](https://github.com/goadesign/goa)
framework that parses and validates JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) that appear in
requests, then adds them to the request context. It supports any JWT algorithm
that uses RSA, ECDSA or HMAC.

For more information, please consult the [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/xeger/goa-jwtauth).
